# mulieri_Mod6

This repo contains the project assignment for module 6 of the CSC6301 course at Merrimack College. The assignment consists of two programs. The first program collects integers from user input, adds them to a Linked List, then sorts the Linked List.
The second program does the same but uses the Stack data structure. Both programs use the Java Collections Framework to faciliate the Linked List and Stack data structures as well as coresponding methods. 

To run the Linked List program from the terminal - cd to the dedicated src directory, type java LL
To run the Stack program from the terminal - cd to the dedicated src directory, type java S

 * To generate javadocs via the terminal cd to src directory and use:
 * javadoc -version -author -d mulierim_04_docs LL.java aList.java sorter.java userInput.java
 * To open javadocs in browser, right click on index.html file within docs directorys.
